"""The open-window detection of §5.2, as On and Off.

The entity table in ``test_entity.py`` pins the row itself, including the
**absent** device class — the panel infers an open window from a temperature
drop rather than watching a contact, so Open/Closed would claim something it
does not know. What is asserted here is that the inference follows the panel
and that a firmware without it simply has no such entity.
