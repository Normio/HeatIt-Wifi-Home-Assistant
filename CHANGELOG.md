# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Eight config numbers** on the panel's device page: both setpoints, the two
  temperature limits, the sensor calibration, the load limit and the two
  display brightnesses. The load limit is in watts and the brightnesses in
  percent, not the panel's own units.
- Setting either **setpoint** from its own number works in any mode, so the eco
  setpoint can be changed while the panel is heating and the other way round.
  The thermostat still only moves the setpoint the panel is regulating to.
- What each of these will let you set **follows the panel**: the setpoints stop
  at the temperature limits, each limit stops half a degree short of the other,
  and the load limit stops at your model's rating.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-11

First release: the **Heatit WiFi Panel** wall heater over its own HTTP API on
your local network — no cloud, no account, no vendor app. Only the thermostat
ships here; the remaining entities follow in later releases.

### Added

- The panel is added as a **device**: one **climate entity**, polled every 60
  seconds by default, and a **diagnostics download** on its device page with
  the panel's identifiers and its address replaced by placeholders.
- The climate entity has off and heat, with **comfort and eco as presets**. The
  target temperature follows whichever setpoint the panel is regulating to, so
  it moves with the preset and is blank while the panel is off
  ([ADR-0004](https://github.com/Normio/HeatIt-Wifi-Home-Assistant/blob/main/docs/adr/0004-eco-as-a-climate-preset.md)). Whether the
  element is on comes from the panel's relay, not from its reported power.

### Verified

- Firmware **1.21** on a 600 W panel. What that rests on is recorded in the
  [conformance register](https://github.com/Normio/HeatIt-Wifi-Home-Assistant/blob/main/docs/conformance/checklist.md).
